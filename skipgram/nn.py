class SkipGram(nn.Module):
    """
    SkipGram neural network class
    containing the model initialisation
    and the definition of the forward
    pass with negative sampling as
    described in Mikolov et al., 2013
    
    Requirements
    ------------
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    vocab_size : int
        size of the vocabulary
    embed_size : int
        word embedding dimensions
    w2v_init : bool, optional
        whether to initialise the embeddings
        with word2vec vectors (default: True)
    w2v_embeds : torch.tensor
        tensor of pretrained word embeddings
        of size |V| x D
    
    Methods
    -------
    forward(focus:List[int], context:List[int],
            neg_indices:ndarray)
        embed the focus and context words into
        two BxD matrices and the negative samples
        into a BxKxD tensor. Use them to calculate
        the loss of the full batch as described in
        Mikolov et al., 2013
